Q.1]

Observation:

	As we created two tasks and used three LEDs (LED 12,LED 13,LED 14)
	
	In taskA we turned on LED1 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	In taskA we turned on LED2 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	In taskA we turned on LED3 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	
	In taskB we turned on LED3 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	In taskB we turned on LED2 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	In taskB we turned on LED1 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	
	
	As both tasks are of same priority task1 will runs first as it is created first and after its time slice gets over task2 will run, till the time task2 is running
	task1 stays in ready state, as soon as task2 time slice gets over task1 will executes.
