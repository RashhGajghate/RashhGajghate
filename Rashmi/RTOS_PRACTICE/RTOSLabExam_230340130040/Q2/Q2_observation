Q.2]

Observation:

	As we created two tasks and used three LEDs (LED 12,LED 13,LED 14)
	
	In taskA we turned on LED1 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	In taskA we turned on LED2 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	In taskA we turned on LED3 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	
	In taskB we turned on LED3 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	In taskB we turned on LED2 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	In taskB we turned on LED1 for 100ms and turned off for 100ms 
	
	As both tasks are of same priority and we used semaphore here task1 will runs first as it is acquiring the semaphore after it gives semaphore task2 will run and
	till the time task2 is running task1 goes block state as it also requires semaphore which is acquire by task2.
	As soon as task2 give semaphore task1 comes in running state and task2 goes to block state.
