xTaskCreate(task1, "task1", 200, NULL, 1, NULL);
xTaskCreate(task2, "task2", 200, NULL, 1, NULL);
xTaskCreate(task3, "task3", 200, NULL, 1, NULL);
xTaskCreate(task4, "task4", 200, NULL, 1, NULL);

Observation : All LEDs are toggling
              Time slice equally distributed among the four task.
		    As all four task have same priority.
		    
xTaskCreate(task1, "task1", 200, NULL, 2, NULL);
xTaskCreate(task2, "task2", 200, NULL, 1, NULL);
xTaskCreate(task3, "task3", 200, NULL, 1, NULL);
xTaskCreate(task4, "task4", 200, NULL, 1, NULL);

Observation : Only LED 12 is toggling
		    Scheduling policy is priority pre-emptive.
		    After completing the toggling of LED 12 it is put in Ready queue and again LED 12 toggles
		    If in case High priority blocks then low priority can runs.
		    
xTaskCreate(task1, "task1", 200, NULL, 2, NULL);
xTaskCreate(task2, "task2", 200, NULL, 2, NULL);
xTaskCreate(task3, "task3", 200, NULL, 1, NULL);
xTaskCreate(task4, "task4", 200, NULL, 1, NULL);

Observation :LED 12 and LED 13 are toggling
		   As Task1 and Task2 have same higher priority 2
		   If high priority gets block low priority task can run.
